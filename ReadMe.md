This project uses generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

You'll be using two datasets in this project:

MNIST
CelebA

Since the celebA dataset is complex and doing GANs in this project for the first time, you will want to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will allow you to see how well your model trains sooner.

If you're using FloydHub, set data_dir to "/input" and use the FloydHub data ID "R5KrjnANiKVhLWAkpXhNBe".

This project was created as part of Udacity's Deep Learning nano-degree program.
